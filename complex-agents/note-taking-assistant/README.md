This demo shows a medical note-taking assistant that transcribes conversations between doctors and patients, generating structured medical notes in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time transcription of conversations using Deepgram Flux
- Automatic medical note generation using Cerebras
- Live frontend display showing:
  - Current medical notes being generated
  - Recent transcriptions
- RPC communication between backend agent and frontend

## Architecture

- **Backend Agent**: Python agent that handles transcription and note generation
- **Frontend**: Next.js application displaying notes and transcriptions in real-time
- **Communication**: Uses LiveKit RPC for real-time updates from backend to frontend

## Running the Application

### Backend Agent

1. Install Python dependencies if not already installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the agent:
```bash
python complex-agents/note-taking-assistant/agent.py dev
```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd complex-agents/note-taking-assistant/note-taker-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. Start both the backend agent and frontend
2. Connect to the room from the frontend interface
3. Start speaking - the agent will transcribe your speech
4. Medical notes will be automatically generated and displayed on the left side
5. Recent transcriptions will appear in the top box
6. The full medical notes will accumulate in the main notes section

## How It Works

1. **Speech Capture**: User speech is captured and transcribed using Deepgram STT
2. **Buffering**: Transcriptions are held until the speaker is finished speaking, when the speaker is finished the final transcript is immediately triggered by Deepgram.
3. **Note Generation**: When the final transcript is delivered, the notes are generated by GPT-OSS-120B via Cerebras
4. **RPC Updates**: The backend sends updates to the frontend via RPC with:
   - Current medical notes
   - Recent transcription (last few sentences processed)
5. **Frontend Display**: The frontend displays both the notes and recent transcriptions in real-time
- Medications
- Family history
- Social history

LiveKit Voice Agent Example: Law Office Reception with Pre-roll Audio and Office Hours Logic

This example demonstrates a voice AI agent that acts as a law office receptionist with the following features:

1. Pre-roll Audio: Plays a pre-recorded audio file when the agent first enters the session
2. Office Hours Logic: Automatically switches between two modes based on current time:
   - Office Open (8 AM - 5 PM): Full interactive agent with STT, LLM, and TTS capabilities
   - Office Closed (outside 8 AM - 5 PM): Plays background audio loop (closed.mp3) continuously for N seconds, then hangup call then hangs up
3. Voice Agent: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini for natural language processing
4. Audio Processing: Supports both pre-synthesized audio playback and real-time TTS generation

The agent greets callers during office hours and provides a professional law office experience,
while offering appropriate messaging when the office is closed.
